1.
A Regular Expression is used for identifying a search pattern in a text string.
It also helps in finding out the correctnessof the data and even operations as finding,
replacing and formatting the data is possible using Regular Expressions.
2.
Regular Expression are particularly useful for defining filters.Regular Expression contain 
a series of characters that define a pattern of text to be matched and to make specialized ,or general.
3.
Square brackets match something that we kind of dont know about a string we are looking for.
4.
The compile()function takes as input a simple regular expresssion
 and produces a compiled expression that can be used with the step()and advance () functions.
5.
We can combine a regular expression pattern into pattern objects, which can be used for pattern matching.
 It also helps to search a pattern again without rewriting it
6.
Python has a module named re to work with RegEx.
 Here's an example: import re pattern = '^a...s$' test_string = 'abyss' result = re. match(pattern, test_string)
 if result: print("Search successful.") else: print("Search unsuccessful.")
7.
The vertical bar is a regex "or" means "a or b"
 Square brackets are a character class meaning "any character from a or b. Character class is a shorthand for "or".
8.
Raw strings help you get the "source code" of a RegEx safely to the RegEx parser,
 which will then assign meaning to character sequences like \d , \w , \n , etc.
